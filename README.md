# tetris-4w-solver
Programs to compute optimal solutions to maximize various objectives in 4w mode.

## Todo:
- Optimize `generate_all_pc_queues` to run for `n = 8` and `n = 10`
- Generate a very long queue and determine best pc decisions given limited queue vision
- Adapt code to compute combo and downstack
